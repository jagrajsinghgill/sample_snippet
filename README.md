# Short Sample Snippet of Code

This README file provides context and explains the use case of the included code snippet.


## What does it do?

- This is a custom controller that renders a dedicated admin page.
- The controller is located at: `/modules/custom/sample_module/src/Controller/ManageVersions.php`
- The page is accessible via a route defined in the module's `sample_module.routing.yml` file.
- The purpose of this page is to display multiple versions of a specific application.
- From this interface, administrators can:
  - View all previously published versions along with their respective publish timestamps.
  - Publish a new version.
  - Preview any version of the application.
  - Access a review page that displays all associated content for verification before publishing.

## Why was this approach used?

- Although Views could have been used to build this page, a custom controller was chosen due to specific functional requirements.
- The page needed to handle custom configuration logic to support comparison between different versions.
- Several helper functions were required to manage version-related data and conditional logic.
- Based on this logic, the page includes conditionally enabled/disabled operational links, which could not have been effectively handled through Views alone.
